1. Search in a Rotated Array 
  Given a sorted and rotated array A of N distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element key. The task is to find the index of the given element key in the array A. The whole array A is given as the range to search.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 9
A[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}
key = 10
l = 0 , h = 8
Output:
5
Explanation: 10 is found at index 5.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {3, 5, 1, 2}
key = 6
l = 0 , h = 3
Output:
-1
Explanation: There is no element that has value 6.

code:
class Solution:
    def search(self, A : list, l : int, h : int, key : int):
        # l: The starting index
        # h: The ending index, you have to search the key in this range
        # Complete this function
        l=0
        h=len(A)-1
        while l<=h:
            mid=l+((h-l)//2)
            # to find th middle element in array 
            if A[mid]==key:
                return mid
            elif A[mid]>=A[0]:
                if A[l]<=key and A[mid]>=key:
                    h=mid-1
                else:
                    l=mid+1
            else:
                if A[h]>=key and A[mid]<=key:
                    l=mid+1
                else:
                    h=mid-1
                    
        return -1
2.Multiply two strings
Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.

Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers. You don't need to specify '+' sign in the begining of positive numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
s1 = "0033"
s2 = "2"
Output:
66
Example 2:

Input:
s1 = "11"
s2 = "23"
Output:
253

code:
    class Solution:
    def multiplyStrings(self,s1,s2):
        return str(int(s1)*int(s2)) #first type cast into int and then multiply
